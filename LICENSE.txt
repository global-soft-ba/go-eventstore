Community License Agreement (Bi-Temporal Event Store)

Preamble
Globalsoft b.a., Široki Brijeg, Bosnia and Herzegovina, (hereinafter referred to as
"Licensor") provides the source code and binary versions of "Bi-Temporal Event
Store" (hereinafter referred to as "Software") under the terms of this Community
License Agreement. The purpose of this license is to enable use for development,
testing, research, and internal purposes, while at the same time excluding the
unauthorized commercial operation of "Bi-Temporal Event Store" as a service by third
parties.

1. Grant of License
  1.1 The Licensor grants the Licensee a worldwide, simple (non-exclusive), non-
  transferable and – subject to Section 1.1(c) – non-sublicensable right to use the
  Software, including the source code, which is revocable in the event of violations
  pursuant to Section 2. This right of use exists exclusively in accordance with this
  Agreement and includes, to the extent necessary for the intended use:
      (a) installing, loading, executing, and operating the software in the Licensee's IT
      environment, including in cloud accounts controlled by the Licensee (without
      provision to third parties);
      (b) the reproductions technically necessary for operation, security, and restarting
      (including appropriate backup copies);
      (c) use by employees, freelancers, and other vicarious agents of the Licensee and—
      if affiliated companies under uniform management within the meaning of Article 32 of
      the Law on Business Entities in the Federation of BiH are involved—by them,
      provided that the licensee remains fully responsible for their contractual use;
      (d) the creation and use of its own modifications and forks in accordance with Section
      3 exclusively for the purposes permitted in this Agreement;
      (e) Reservation of rights: All rights not expressly granted remain with the licensor.
  1.2 Permitted uses (in particular):
      - Use for development, testing, and internal business purposes;
      - Integration into own software products;
      - On-premises deployment in unlimited numbers;
      - Use by non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and for research purposes.

2. Restrictions
  2.1 Any use beyond the scope described in sections 1 and 1.2 is prohibited. In
  particular, but not limited to, the following is prohibited:
      (a) the provision of the software or derivative works as "EventStore-as-a-Service" or
      in a comparable form, in which third parties are granted access via the Internet or
      other networks, either for a fee or free of charge;
      (b) managed hosting or offering of the software by cloud providers (e.g., AWS, GCP,
      Azure) or comparable infrastructure providers, insofar as these enable operation as
      a service for third parties;
      (c) reselling, leasing, or otherwise transferring the software as a standalone product
      for a fee without the prior written consent of the licensor;
      (d) use for the provision of commercial SaaS services, consulting or integration
      services that are in direct competition with the cloud or enterprise services offered by
      the licensor;
      (e) any action that is likely to circumvent the licensor's technical protection measures
      or undermine the license terms.
  2.2 Volume limitation: Free use of the software under this license is limited to an
  annual data volume of no more than 50 million events or use by a maximum of
  100,000 end users, whichever threshold is reached first. "Event" within the meaning
  of this provision is any persisted event unit stored in the database within the scope of
  event sourcing. "End users" are natural persons who directly or indirectly access the
  data generated or managed by the software via a software application. If either of
  these thresholds is exceeded, the purchase of a separate commercial license is
  mandatory. Any use beyond these limits without the appropriate license constitutes a
  breach of contract and entitles the licensor to immediately revoke the rights of use
  and assert claims for damages.

3. Source code
  3.1 The licensee is entitled to view, reproduce, technically analyze, and modify or
  extend the source code of the software for their own purposes. These rights exist
  exclusively within the scope of the uses expressly permitted in this agreement.
  3.2 Publications or distributions of modifications, forks, or derivative works are only
  permitted if they do not violate the restrictions in Section 2 and do not constitute use
  as a service, cloud offering, or independent commercial product. Any public provision
  must be made while retaining the licensor's copyright and license notices.
  3.3 The licensee may use and further develop its own extensions internally. External
  disclosure is only permitted in a non-commercial context for research, teaching, or
  open-source collaborations, provided that no third-party rights are infringed and the
  provisions of this agreement are strictly adhered to.
  3.4 The licensor reserves the exclusive right to use the "Bi-Temporal Event Store"
  trademark in connection with official versions and publications. Modified versions may
  not be distributed under this trademark or under names that could be confused with
  it. The licensee must ensure that it is made clear that this is an unofficial, modified
  version.
  3.5 Any use of the source code or derivative works that exceeds the rights expressly
  granted in this agreement requires the prior written consent of the Licensor and may
  require a separate commercial license.

4. Warranty and Liability
  4.1 The software is provided to the licensee free of charge and in its current form ("as
  is"). No express or implied warranty is given, in particular for the absence of errors,
  specific functionalities, or suitability for a particular purpose. Mandatory legal
  provisions, in particular consumer protection regulations, remain unaffected if they
  stipulate otherwise.
  4.2 The Licensor shall only be liable for intent and gross negligence as well as for
  injury to life, limb, or health. In the event of a slightly negligent breach of a material
  contractual obligation (cardinal obligation), liability shall be limited to the foreseeable
  damage typical for this type of contract. Any further liability is excluded.
  4.3 Liability for indirect damage, consequential damage or loss of profit is excluded,
  unless the Licensor has caused this intentionally or through gross negligence.
  4.4 The above limitations of liability also apply in favor of the Licensor's legal
  representatives, employees, and other vicarious agents. They cover all contractual,
  non-contractual, and statutory claims of the Licensee.
  4.5 Mandatory claims under the Product Liability Act remain unaffected.

5. Data protection
  5.1 The Community Edition is provided exclusively as on-premises software. The
  Licensor does not collect, store, or process any personal data of the Licensee within
  the scope of this license.
  5.2 If the Licensee processes personal data with the software, they are solely
  responsible for compliance with the relevant data protection laws, in particular the
  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Licensor assumes no responsibility
  or liability for this.
  5.3 The Licensee shall ensure that all necessary technical and organizational
  measures for the protection of personal data are complied with insofar as it processes
  such data with the software.

6. Trademarks and copyrights
  6.1 All rights, titles, and legal claims to the software, including all copies,
  modifications, and derivative works, remain with the Licensor, unless expressly stated
  otherwise in this Agreement.
  6.2 The name, logo, and trademark "Bi-Temporal Event Store" are protected
  trademarks of the Licensor. These may only be used by the Licensee in direct
  connection with the permitted use of the software and not in a manner that creates
  the impression of an official connection or support by the Licensor.
  6.3 The Licensee undertakes to retain all copyright notices, trademark labels, or other
  references to the Licensor's property rights in the software and associated
  documentation unchanged.

7. Term and termination of the agreement
  7.1 This license is valid indefinitely, provided that the licensee complies with the terms
  of this agreement.
  7.2 The Licensor is entitled to terminate this license without notice and to revoke the
  Licensee's rights if the Licensee violates essential provisions, in particular the
  restrictions under Section 2.
  7.3 In the event of termination of the license, the licensee must immediately cease
  use of the software, delete all copies, and, at the licensor's request, provide proof of
  their destruction.
  7.4 Rights to claim damages and injunctive relief remain unaffected by termination.

8. Final provisions
  8.1 The law of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall apply exclusively, excluding the UN
  Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).
  8.2 Bosnia and Herzegovina shall be the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes
  arising from or in connection with this contract, provided that the licensee is a
  merchant, a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law. However,
  the licensor shall also be entitled to bring claims against the licensee at the licensee's
  general place of jurisdiction.
  8.3 Amendments and supplements to this contract must be made in writing. This also
  applies to any amendment to this written form requirement.
  8.4 Should any provision of this contract be or become invalid or unenforceable in
  whole or in part, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. The
  parties undertake to replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and
  enforceable provision that comes as close as possible to the economic intent. The
  same applies to any contractual loopholes.
  8.5 Insofar as further agreements between the parties exist in addition to this contract,
  the provisions of this contract shall take precedence in case of doubt, unless
  expressly agreed otherwise.
